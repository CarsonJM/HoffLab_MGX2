Pipeline To Do:
- Append new spacer meta to current spacer meta
- Add iPhoP to pipeline
- Cluster viruses with IMG/VR using vContact2
- Test DRAMv (change VirSorter output and contig names)
- Add additional HMM databases to DRAMv
- Implement MAG pipeline (bulk only)
- Implement provirus activity module (bulk only)

Benchmarking To Do:
Oral in silico mock community (virome & bulk)
- Re-make dereplicated mock community
- Benchmark virus enrichment (virome vs bulk)
- Benchmark virus assembly recovery and chimera (metaspades, metaviralspades, rnaviralspades, and combined)
- Benchmark clustering effect on recovery and chimera (db only, assembly only, assembly and db)
- Benchmark virus identification (Individual vs combined)
- Benchmark virus quality (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus abundance (breadth & depth)
- Benchmark virus host PHIST, iPHoP, and vOTU (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus taxonomy MMseqs2, HMM, vOTU, vcontact2  (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
